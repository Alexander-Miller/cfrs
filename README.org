* pfr.el -- Pos-Frame-Read

pfr.el is a very simply (mostly-) reimplementation of ~read-string~ that allows reading input via a small child-frame
spawned at the position of the cursor. Its goal is to make these inputs more like those used in modern GUI programs and
to prevent the user from having to switch focus from whatever they are doing currently to look at the input in the
minibuffer.

There is just one single entry point, ~pfr-read~, and its interface simple enough to not require further explanation:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun pfr-read (prompt &optional initial-input) ... )
#+END_SRC

The text in the resulting child-frame can be edit freely, with the caveat that it is meant to fit on a single line -
pfr.el is meant for /simple/ inputs. The input can be confirmed via either ~C-c C-c~ or ~RET~.

A runnable example:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (let ((input (pfr-read "Text: " "Initial Input")))
    (message "Hello %s!" input))
#+END_SRC
